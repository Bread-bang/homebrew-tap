  caveats <<~EOS
    Claude Usage lives in the menu bar and has no Dock icon. Launch it with:

      open -a "Claude Usage"

    or from Spotlight / Launchpad. It reads your usage from Claude Code, so make sure
    you have signed in once (run `claude`). To start it automatically, add it under
    System Settings → General → Login Items.
